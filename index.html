                        restaurant. With Pen’s parents Rod and Stacey, the family owns Black Estate. Together they grow
                        wine, talk too much about the weather, and fight the good fight.
                        <br><br>
                        We’re set on making our wines true to the place they grow. The winemaking is simple - good
                        estate
                        grown fruit, organic & biodynamic, handpicked, vineyard derived yeasts, no additives or fining,
                        mininal sulphur at bottling and where possible, no filtration. Then we
                        have character.</p>

                    <div class="line"></div>
                    <p>The Home Vineyard is located 6 kilometres north east of the Waipara Junction, in the
                        Omihi
                        sub-district of Waipara Valley, North Canterbury. The slope is a north facing
                        sedimentary
                        clay fan
                        on a gentle hill side slope. The soils are mainly Awapuni clay loam with calcium
                        carbonate
                        deposits.

                        The vineyard was planted by the late Russell and Kimiko Black. The Pinot Noir was
                        planted in
                        a 3.8
                        ha block. Un-grafted predominantly 10-5 clone and were planted in 1994 at a vine
                        density
                        of
                        1841
                        vines per hectare. The vineyard was irrigated once in 1998.

                        The Chardonnay grows in the adjacent 3.8ha block. Un-grafted Mendoza Chardonnay
                        vines
                        were
                        planted
                        in 1994 at a vine density of 1841 vines per hectare.

                    <p>Damsteep Vineyard (formally Spye) is located in the north east of Waipara Valley at
                        the
                        foot
                        of the Omihi Saddle, 10km north of our Home Vineyard. Riesling and Pinot Noir grow
                        here
                        with
                        vine density of more than 5000 vine per hectare.

                        Pinot Noir is grown on a 5 hectare north east facing slope, with an altitude between
                        140
                        to
                        180 meters above sea level. The vines here were planted in 1999 and grow on clay
                        overlying
                        fractured limestone and sandstone soils.
                        The Riesling vineyard is 2.2 ha and lies on a north facing slope below the pinot
                        noir.
                        The
                        soil is in very dense brown/ orange clay and inter bedded with sandstones and
                        subordinate
                        limestone horizons.

                    <div class="line"></div>
                    <p>Planted by Russell Black and Daniel Schuster in 1986 at a vine density of 5000
                        vines
                        per
                        hectare. Netherwood’s soils are classified as Waipara Greensand which is a green
                        grey
                        richly
                        glauconitic sandstone.

                        Pinot Noir cuttings were planted here on their own roots and established and
                        farmed
                        without
                        irrigation. The Chardonnay block is 0.8 hectares and was planted in 1986 on a
                        south
                        facing
                        hillside. The vines are mass selection and thought to be cuttings of Mendoza
                        Chardonnay.
                        The
                        vine density should be 5000 vines per hectare but half of them are Pinot Noir so
                        it
                        is
                        hard

                    <p>The season’s fruit has been picked, fermented and is now wintering over in barrel or tank. We had
                        perfect weather for picking and harvest was calm and, well quite lovely with a smaller than
                        usual yield due to poor flowering. The quality of the havest is exciting. Now we and our wine
                        rest…until pruning in June and the wines stirring in spring.</p>
